# Commandline Virus Scanner
_A simple virus scanner utilising VirusTotal public API. It's run as a script taking file paths separated with commas as arguments._

## Features
Quickly scan files (including archives?) downloaded from the Internet without opening them on your computer. VirusTotal runs multiple scans with dozens of antivirus programmes and checks if a file is safe to use. It's all done in a matter of seconds (read more about VirusTotal <VirusTotal link>)

* command line
